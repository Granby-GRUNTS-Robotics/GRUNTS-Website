# Supplementary: Kickoff!

Happy Kickoff! The Granby GRUNTS started off our season with a bang, like usual, with our Kickoff event, celebration with returning alumni, and a solid start to our design and build process.

## Kickoff watch-party
Like usual, the team and alumni met at the High School to watch the Kickoff broadcast. While this year looked a little different than usual, we all still had a blast!  
This year's game, Rapid React, first shown during the Kickoff event, proved to be very interesting for many of our new members. For most of the team, this is the first time they'd witnessed a game reveal, but that didn't slow us down! Right out of the gate, the GRUNTS were ready to go!


## Design Process

Like any good design, we started with small-scale models to help convey the ideas our team came up with. Here, we modeled our ideas in LEGO pieces, before moving on to more sophisticated designs in CAD.  
  
Before moving forward with any of our ideas, a thorough review of the [rules and season guidelines](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2022/Manual/2022FRCGameManual.pdf) took place to ensure that we are allowed to build such a mechanism. Like any game, a FIRST Robotics Competition has many rules to comply with so that everyone can play fairly.

Thanks for sticking with us! We're excited to be back to it with a new season, and we can't wait to share with you what we come up with this year! Cheers!
