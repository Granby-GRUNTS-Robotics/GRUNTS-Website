            The Granby GRUNTS Robotics Team was formed in 2009. In 2015, our team won both the CT State and Pioneer Valley Championships, placed 11th at the New England District Championship, and finished in the top 1% of the world at the 2015 International Competition in St. Louis, MO. In 2019, our team managed to make it back to the International Championships in Detroit, MI.

            Our students have the chance to learn and develop many new skills. Although the robotics program is based on engineering and design, The program reinforces other important facets of being a part of the workforce such as leadership, business planning, public speaking, coaching, and communications.
